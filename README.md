# Assignment 1: Python Basics with AI

## Overview
This assignment introduces you to Python programming fundamentals while teaching you how to effectively collaborate with AI tools. You'll use an AI assistant to generate practice problems, then work through them to build your programming skills.

**Key Goals:**
- Learn Python basics: variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Practice effective AI collaboration techniques
- Build problem-solving skills through guided practice

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

## Part 1: Generate Your Problem Set

### Step 1: Create Your Practice Problems
Use an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate a personalized problem set. Here's a sample prompt to get you started:

> "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with [mention your previous programming language if any, or say 'I'm new to programming']. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:
> - Variables and basic data types
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs."

### Step 2: Document Your Problems
Copy the AI-generated problems into your `a1.py` file. Include the original prompt you used and the problems the AI created.

## Part 2: Solve with AI Collaboration

For each problem, follow this learning process:

### üîç **First Attempt (Independent)**
- Read the problem carefully
- Try solving it using your existing knowledge and class notes
- Write pseudocode or comments explaining your approach

### ü§ù **Get Strategic Help**
If you're stuck, ask the AI for guidance **without asking for the complete solution**:

**Good prompts:**
- "Can you explain the approach to solve this problem step by step, without giving me the full code?"
- "What Python concepts do I need to understand to solve this?"
- "Can you give me a hint about the logic I should use?"

**Avoid these prompts:**
- "Write the complete function for me"
- "Give me the answer"
- "Fix my code" (without explaining what you tried)

### üí° **Learn Through Implementation**
When you need specific help:
- "How do I check if a number is even in Python?"
- "What's the syntax for a for loop that counts from 1 to n?"
- "How do I add an item to a list?"

### üß† **Understand the Solution**
After implementing each solution, always ask:
- "Can you explain why this code works and what each part does?"
- "What would happen if I changed [specific part] of the code?"
- "Are there other ways to solve this problem?"

## Part 3: Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### ‚úÖ **Effective AI Usage**
1. **Learn the basics first** - Don't rely entirely on AI for fundamental concepts
2. **Ask for explanations** - Always understand why code works, don't just copy-paste
3. **Solve real problems** - Work on the specific problems you generated
4. **Verify and research** - Double-check AI responses with documentation or Google search

### üîç **Always Read Documentation**
- When AI mentions a Python function you don't know, look it up in the official [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- If AI suggests a library that doesn't exist, research it yourself
- Reading documentation builds deeper understanding than AI explanations alone

### üêõ **Debugging Strategy**
1. Write your program
2. Test it yourself first
3. Read any error messages carefully
4. Google the error if you don't understand it
5. Ask AI for help with specific errors, not general "fix my code"
6. Read documentation for any solutions you implement

## Example AI Interactions

### Good Example:
**Student:** "How can I check if a number is divisible by 3 in Python?"

**Follow-up:** "Thanks! Now can you explain why the modulo operator (%) works for checking divisibility?"

### Better Example:
**Student:** "I'm trying to write a function that counts vowels in a string. I think I need to loop through each character and check if it's a vowel, but I'm not sure about the syntax for checking if a character is in a list of vowels."

**Follow-up:** "That makes sense! Can you also show me how to make this case-insensitive?"

## Tips for Success

- **Start early** - Give yourself time to experiment and learn
- **Be curious** - Ask follow-up questions when AI gives you interesting answers
- **Test your code** - Make sure your solutions work with different inputs
- **Document your process** - Keep notes on what you learn for your writeup
- **Ask for help** - If you're stuck on AI collaboration strategies, ask Mr. Berg!

**Good luck, and have fun exploring Python with your AI learning partner!**
