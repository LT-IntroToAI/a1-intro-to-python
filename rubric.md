## Grading Notes

You'll be graded on your **writeup and reflection**, not just whether your code works. I'm looking for:
- Evidence that you generated meaningful problems
- Documentation of your learning process
- Thoughtful reflection on AI collaboration
- Understanding of Python concepts (not just working code)

Remember: The goal is to **learn programming** while building **AI collaboration skills** that will help you throughout your career.
